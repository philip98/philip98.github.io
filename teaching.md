# Teaching
* Autumn 2024/5: *Lie Groups* for MasterMath (RU), taught by Erik Koelink and Walter van Suijlekom  
My tasks included: giving exercise classes (once every two weeks), marking homework.
* Winter 2023/4: *Analyse 1* at RU, taught by Annegret Burtscher  
My tasks included: formulating weekly homework questions, quizzes, and providing solutions for them.
* Winter 2022/3: *Analyse 1* at RU, taught by Erik Koelink  
Tasks see previous.
* Spring 2021/2 and 2020/1: *Electrodynamics* at UvA, taught by
Jean-Sébastien Caux  
My tasks included: giving (twice-weekly) exercise classes, formulating homework questions, marking homework and exam.
* Winter 2021/2 and 2020/1: *Mathematical Methods 3* at UvA, taught by Arghavan Safavi Naini  
My tasks included: giving (twice-weekly) exercise classes, marking homework and
exam.
* Autumn 2021/2 and 2020/1: *Wiskunde N2* at UvA, taught by Sergey Shadrin  
My tasks included: giving (twice-weekly) exercise classes, marking homework.
* Autumn 2021/2: *Klassieke mechanica en speciale relativiteitstheorie 1* at UvA
taught by Alejandra Castro Anich and Kjeld Eikema
My tasks included: giving (twice-weekly) exercise classes, providing solutions
to the SR questions, marking mid-term and final exam.
* Spring 2018/9: *Analysis 2* at UniKN, taught by Heinrich Freistühler  
My tasks included: teaching weekly exercise classes, marking homework and exam.
* Autumn/Winter 2018/9: *Algebra* at UniKN, taught by Claus Scheiderer

The Mathewerkstatt was a weekly offer where 1st-year students could work together on
their homework.

## Elucidation on Exercise Classes
In Germany (meaning: Algebra and Analysis 2), students work at home (or at the
Mathewerkstatt) on their homework, hand it in, and then receive it back
during the exercise class. The exercise class exists to discuss good solutions.
Depending on the quality of hand-ins, the students are often asked to present
their solutions.

In the Netherlands (meaning: everything else), exercise classes are an occasion
where students can work on their homework together under the supervision of
someone familiar with the contents of the course. The TA's work mostly involves
answering questions and explaining topics from the lectures. This more or less
corresponds to what I did for Mathewerkstatt (except Mathewerkstatt only
existed for the first year courses: Einführung in das mathematische Arbeiten,
Analysis 1&2, Linear Algebra 1&2, Computereinsatz in der Mathematik, 
Modellierung, but then also required expertise in all of these subjects).
familiarity with all the first-year courses:
